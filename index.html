            <span>I discovered my passion for programming at the age of ten when I edited and 
                tried to create my own custom maps for games like Warcraft III and Unreal Tournament.<br/><br/> 
                Since then, I have always been involved with computers and programming, 
                trying to bring my ideas and concepts from my mind into the digital world.</span>

            <br/><br/>

            <span>You will always find me working on some personal project, starting 
                with an idea or fixing existing ones. I am always working on new projects in my free time (usually games),
                I like to automate manual server tasks with bash on Linux 
                and think about new spells for RPGs. The ideas never stop flowing.</span>

            <p>
                <h3>A little more about me</h3>
                My first experience with a computer that I remember was with Windows 98 computers in my school's computer lab when I was 7 years old.<br/><br/>

                At 9 years old, my father bought a computer with Windows XP where I remember playing 
                Raptor and Pekka Kanna 2. With this same computer, I discovered games like 
                Generally, Half-Life, UT99, and Warcraft III.<br/><br/>

                It was with this last game that I got into the World Editor, the game's map editor. 
                I started by modifying maps that were already created, like WarChasers, to understand how they worked, 
                until I began creating my own versions of these map models with blank maps. I learned more about triggers and the 
                steps of game development, even if in an offline and rudimentary way.<br/><br/>

                In 2007, at the age of 11, I got access to the internet at home via radio connection because I lived on a farm. 
                Through Battle.Net, I met friends with whom I still keep in touch and learned more about development by joining forums and communities.<br/><br/>

                At some point in my early teens, I studied Visual Basic in a computer course I attended in my town. This was my 
                "first" contact with a language that wasn't a game's internal programming language.<br/><br/>

                At 16, I joined a technical course in computer science in my town and discovered Delphi. I was amazed by the fact that 
                I could now create my own executable files (.exe) and quickly started developing various types of projects using the components available in the IDE.<br/><br/>

                In 2013, at the age of 17, I got a programming job to work with Delphi and Firebird, developing and maintaining accounting 
                systems for offices.<br/><br/>

                In 2014, I started college in Computer Engineering, where I had contact with robotics subjects like Arduino and PIC, as 
                well as subjects like Computer Graphics, Mobile Development, Networks, and Data Structures.<br/><br/>

                In 2022, I was working in backend development with NodeJS but also had some knowledge of React.<br/><br/>

                During this period, I have developed freelance projects in Python, automations for Raspberry PI, and PHP.<br/><br/>

                Currently, I focus my free time on studying, especially on my <a onclick="changeTab(event, 'projects')" href="#">projects</a> and Linux server management.<br/><br/>

                        One of my most recent projects that I've been working on for the past few months. 
                        Boltcraft II counts for me as a new experiment. The style of using procedural generation for the first time, 
                        fog of war, minimap, and equippable weapons make this version of the game surpass the first one both graphically 
                        and technically. The only thing I initially planned to implement was Co-op multiplayer, but that will have to wait 
                        for the next edition. xD<br/><br/>
                        This game was made using version 1.5 of Monolith, which was continued from version 1.34 of the first Boltcraft.<br/><br/>
                        The game is complete and totally free to download and play on itch.io <a href="https://lucasmence.itch.io/boltcraft-ii">here</a>!<br/><br/>

                        After a few years of being 100% on Linux, 
                        formatting and installing on a machine (especially if testing other distros) becomes a repetitive process of 
                        installing the dependencies I use daily.<br/><br/>

                        So, I developed a small set of scripts to automate the task in a modular way, 
                        allowing me to configure it differently depending on the machine I'm installing it on (Work or Personal).<br/><br/>
